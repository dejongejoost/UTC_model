The raw simulation data for Polti et al. (2018) were too large to upload on Github. 
You can download them through the follow link:
polti_etal_2018: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23450240

Place all .tex files in its respective subfolder (i.e., 'polti_etal_2018') and
you'll be able to load in the raw data (note: this takes some time).
